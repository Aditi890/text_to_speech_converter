# text_to_speech_converter
This project is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system built in Python that converts any given text input into natural-sounding speech with an Indian English accent. Using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library, the program generates clear and human-like audio output in .mp3 format.
